      `It took typing a command on a Commodore 64 to spark a curiousity in how and why this works. I didn't know that the programming language was BASIC at the time but I knew it was powerful enough to do some interesting things. I lost a lot of game time from reading the documentation.`,
      `After going through various Computer Science curriculums, nothing truly stuck until I randomly googled python because a friend had used it a little bit from another class. I was hooked when I saw DeepMind playing Go.`,
      `Now, I enjoy hacking away in Python, React and Bash to name a few. Although I'm not proficient as I'd like to be, I love learning something new or better ways to do things.`,
